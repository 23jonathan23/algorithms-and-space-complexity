- What is a data structure?
 - Allows information to be stored
 - Define how data is stored
 - Define how data is organized
 - Define how data is managment (Access, modified, deleted)
 - Data structure can manipulated by algorithms

- Operations type
    - Insert -> add new item in data structure
    - Delete -> remove existing item in data structure
    - Traversal -> access exactly once each item
    - Searching -> find item in data structure
    - Sorting -> organize/to rank itens in data structure using a condition

- Obs:
 - Each data structure solves one or more problems
 - We must to using data structure suitable for problem to solved
 - Each data type has a number of bits associated with it, which need to be stored in the system
